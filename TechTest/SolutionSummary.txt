I have done the following refactories to the AnyCompany solution:

1. Replace the existing SqlClient code with Entity Framework 6, created seperate project for DBContext and services.
2. Created Interface for OrderRepository and OrderService and moved it to a seperate project.
3. Moved domain models to a seperate project.
4. Implemented StructionMap as Ioc framework.
5. Added console app for the client that consume the service.
6. Replaced AnyCompany.Test project with Unit test project, in which use Moq and FluentAssertions.
7. Removed AnyCompany project from solution.

if I had more time, I could have tried to firgure out a better way to deal with the staic CustomerRepository.
